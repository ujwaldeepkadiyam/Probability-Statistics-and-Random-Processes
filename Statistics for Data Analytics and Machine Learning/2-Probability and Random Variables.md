Counting is a fundamental concept in combinatorics. It Helps determine possible outcomes, optimize decisions, and solve real-world problems.

## <p style="text-align:center;"><font color="red">Basic Counting Principles</font> </p>

Counting techniques help determine the number of ways an event can occur, which is foundational in probability and statistics.

### 1. Counting

Counting is the process of determining how many possible outcomes exist in a situation. Basic counting can involve listing or applying systematic rules.



### 2. Multiplication Rule

If an event can occur in *m* ways and another independent event can occur in *n* ways, then both events together can occur in:

$$
m \times n \text{ ways}
$$

**Example**: If you have 3 shirts and 2 pants, there are  
`3 × 2 = 6` possible outfits.



### 3. Addition Rule

If one event can occur in *m* ways and another mutually exclusive event in *n* ways, then one of the two events can occur in:

$$
m + n \text{ ways}
$$

**Example**: Choosing between 3 types of pizza or 2 types of pasta  
means `3 + 2 = 5` choices in total.



### 4. Permutations

Permutations count **arrangements** of items where **order matters**.

$$
nPr = \frac{n!}{(n - r)!}
$$

**Example**: The number of ways to arrange 3 out of 5 books is:  
`5P3 = 5 × 4 × 3 = 60`



### 5. Combinations

Combinations count **selections** of items where **order does not matter**.

$$
nCr = \frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!}
$$

**Example**: The number of ways to choose 3 books out of 5 is:  
`5C3 = 10`

These principles are essential for analysing probabilities and solving real-world problems involving choices and arrangements.

## <p style="text-align:center;"><font color="red">Probability</font> </p>

**Probability** is a measure of the likelihood that an event will occur. It ranges from 0 (impossible event) to 1 (certain event).

## <p style="text-align:center;"><font color="red">Basic Concepts in Probability</font> </p>

Understanding a few foundational terms is essential when studying probability:

### 1. Outcome
- A single possible result of a random experiment.
- It is an element of the **sample space**.
### 2. Sample Space (S)
- The set of **all possible outcomes** of a random experiment.
### 3. Event (E)
- A subset of the sample space.
- It may contain one or more outcomes.
### 4. Probability of an Event
For **equally likely outcomes**:

$$
P(E) = \frac{|E|}{|S|}
$$

Where:
- \(|E|\) = Number of favourable outcomes
- \(|S|\) = Total number of possible outcomes
### 5. Exhaustive Events
- A set of events is **exhaustive** if it includes **all possible outcomes** in the sample space.
- That is, at least one of the events must occur.

## <p style="text-align:center;"><font color="red">Axioms of Probability</font> </p>

Given a sample space \( S \) and an event \( E \), the probability function \( P \) must satisfy the following three basic axioms:

## 1. Non-negativity
$$
P(E) \geq 0
$$
The probability of any event is always greater than or equal to zero.

## 2. Normalization
$$
P(S) = 1
$$
The probability of the entire sample space is 1.  
This means the sum of probabilities of all possible outcomes equals 1.

## 3. Additivity (Additive Rule)
If $\( E_1, E_2, E_3, \ldots \)$ are **mutually exclusive** (disjoint) events, then:

$$
P(E_1 \cup E_2 \cup E_3 \cup \ldots) = P(E_1) + P(E_2) + P(E_3) + \ldots
$$

This applies only when no two events can happen at the same time.

## <p style="text-align:center;"><font color="red">Mutually Exclusive vs. Independent Events</font> </p>

Understanding the difference between these two concepts is crucial in probability theory.

### 1. Mutually Exclusive Events

Two events are **mutually exclusive** (or disjoint) if **they cannot occur at the same time**.

- If \( A \) and \( B \) are mutually exclusive:

$$
P(A \cap B) = 0
$$

**Example**: When flipping a coin, the events "Heads" and "Tails" are mutually exclusive — both cannot happen on the same flip.

### 2. Independent Events

Two events are **independent** if the occurrence of one **does not affect** the probability of the other.

- If \( A \) and \( B \) are independent:

$$
P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B)
$$

**Example**: Tossing a coin and rolling a die — the result of one has no impact on the other.

**Key Difference**:
- Mutually exclusive: Events **cannot happen together**.
- Independent: Events **can happen together**, but **don’t influence each other**.

## <p style="text-align:center;"><font color="red">Rules of Probability</font> </p>

These are fundamental rules for calculating the probabilities of combined or related events.

### 1. Addition Rule (Mutually Exclusive Events)
If events \( A \) and \( B \) cannot occur at the same time (i.e., they are **mutually exclusive**):

$$
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)
$$

### 2. Multiplication Rule (Independent Events)
If events \( A \) and \( B \) are **independent** (the occurrence of one does not affect the other):

$$
P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B)
$$

### 3. Complement Rule
The probability that event \( A \) does **not** occur is:

$$
P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)
$$

Where \( A<sup>c</sup> \) represents the **complement** of event \( A \).

## <p style="text-align:center;"><font color="red">Conditional Probability</font> </p>

### Conditional Probability

**Conditional probability** is the probability of an event occurring **given** that another event has already occurred.

- Denoted as \( P(A \mid B) \): "Probability of A given B."

$$
P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}, \quad \text{if } P(B) > 0
$$



### Independence

Two events \( A \) and \( B \) are **independent** if the occurrence of one does **not affect** the probability of the other.

This means:

$$
P(A \mid B) = P(A)
$$

or equivalently,

$$
P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B)
$$


- **Conditional probability** involves dependence between events. 
- **Independence** means no influence between events.
- **Mutually exclusive** events are dependent events.

## <p style="text-align:center;"><font color="red">Law of Total Probability and Bayes' Rule</font></p>

### Law of Total Probability

### Think of it as:
Looking **forward** from causes to outcomes.

### What it helps with:
Calculates the **overall probability** of an outcome based on multiple possible scenarios.

### Formula:
If events \( A_1, A_2, ..., A_n \) form a partition of the sample space:

$$
P(B) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} P(B \mid A_i) \cdot P(A_i)
$$



### Bayes’ Rule

### Think of it as:
Looking **backward** from outcomes to causes.

### What it helps with:
**Updates** the probability of a cause given that an outcome has occurred.

### Formula:
$$
P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
$$



### Big Picture: How They Differ

| Concept                  | Law of Total Probability     | Bayes’ Rule                       |
|--------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Direction                | Forward: Cause → Outcome     | Backward: Outcome → Cause         |
| Purpose                  | Find total probability       | Update belief given evidence      |
| Known                   | Cause probabilities and likelihoods | Outcome occurred                 |
| Unknown                | Overall outcome probability   | Cause given an outcome            |



### Pizza Delivery Example

- 60% of orders are from **Restaurant A**, 20% of A's pizzas are **late**  
- 40% of orders are from **Restaurant B**, 50% of B's pizzas are **late**

### Law of Total Probability:
What is the probability that a pizza is late?

$$
P(\text{Late}) = P(\text{Late} \mid A) \cdot P(A) + P(\text{Late} \mid B) \cdot P(B)
$$

$$
P(\text{Late}) = 0.20 \cdot 0.60 + 0.50 \cdot 0.40 = 0.12 + 0.20 = 0.32
$$

### Bayes' Rule:
Given that a pizza is late, what is the probability it came from **B**?

$$
P(B \mid \text{Late}) = \frac{P(\text{Late} \mid B) \cdot P(B)}{P(\text{Late})}
$$

$$
P(B \mid \text{Late}) = \frac{0.50 \cdot 0.40}{0.32} = \frac{0.20}{0.32} \approx 0.625
$$

So, **if your pizza is late, there's a 62.5% chance it came from Restaurant B**.

## <p style="text-align:center;"><font color="red">Random Variables</font></p>

A **random variable** is a numerical description of the outcome of a statistical experiment. It assigns numbers to outcomes of a random experiment.

### Definition:
A random variable is a **function** defined on a sample space \( S \),  
that associates a **real number** with each outcome in \( S \).

### Conceptual Mapping:
- Sample Space $S: e_1, e_2, e_3.....$
- Real Line $\mathbb{R}:$ Set of real numbers
- Random Variable: $f(e_i) \in \mathbb{R}$

In other words:

$$
X: S \rightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$

Where $X$ is the random variable, and $X(e)$ is a real number assigned to outcome $e \in S$.

### Types of Random Variables

### 1. Discrete Random Variables
- Take **countable** values.
- Examples:
  - Number of heads in 3 coin tosses
  - Number of defective items in a batch

### 2. Continuous Random Variables
- Take **uncountably infinite** values within an interval.
- Examples:
  - Height of individuals
  - Time taken to complete a task
## <p style="text-align:center;"><font color="red">From Outcomes to Distributions</font></p>

### 1. Random Experiment and Sample Space

A **random experiment** has a set of possible outcomes called the **sample space** \( S \).

Example: Tossing a fair coin twice  
Sample Space:  
$$
S = \{HH, HT, TH, TT\}
$$

### 2. Random Variable: Mapping Outcomes to Numbers

A **random variable** \( X \) is a function that assigns a real number to each outcome in \( S \).

Example: Let \( X \) = number of heads  
$$
X(HH) = 2,\quad X(HT) = 1,\quad X(TH) = 1,\quad X(TT) = 0
$$

Now, the values of \( X \) become:
$$
\{0, 1, 2\}
$$

## 3. Probability Distribution

The **probability distribution** tells us the probability associated with each possible value of the random variable.

For the above example:

| Value of \( X \) | Probability |
|------------------|-------------|
| 0                | 1/4         |
| 1                | 2/4         |
| 2                | 1/4         |

This table represents the **Probability Mass Function (PMF)** of the discrete random variable \( X \).

### Summary: The Mapping of the Flow

**Outcomes** (e.g., HH, HT...) **----------→** **Random Variable Values** (e.g., 0, 1, 2) **-------→**  **Distribution** (e.g., probabilities for each value)

### <p style="text-align:center;"><font color="red">Probability Functions</font></p>

### 1. Probability Mass Function (PMF)

- Used for **discrete random variables**.
- Assigns a probability to each specific value of the random variable.
- Must satisfy:
  - \( 0 \leq P(X = x) \leq 1 \)
  - \( \sum P(X = x) = 1 \)

**Example**: Rolling a fair die  
\( P(X = x) = \frac{1}{6} \) for \( x = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \)

---

### 2. Probability Density Function (PDF)

- Used for **continuous random variables**.
- Represents **density**, not actual probabilities.
- The **probability** of a value falling in an interval \([a, b]\) is the **area under the curve** between \( a \) and \( b \):

$$
P(a \leq X \leq b) = \int_a^b f(x)\, dx
$$

- The total area under the curve is 1.

---

### 3. Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)

- Used for **both discrete and continuous** random variables.
- Gives the **cumulative probability** that the variable is less than or equal to a value \( x \):

$$
F(x) = P(X \leq x)
$$

- Properties:
  - Always **non-decreasing**
  - Ranges from **0 to 1**
  - For continuous variables: \( F'(x) = f(x) \), the PDF

---

**Summary Table:**

| Function | Variable Type | Gives | Key Property |
|----------|----------------|-------|----------------|
| PMF      | Discrete        | Exact probability | Sum of all probabilities = 1 |
| PDF      | Continuous      | Probability density | Area under curve = 1 |
| CDF      | Both            | Cumulative probability | Non-decreasing, from 0 to 1 |

##  <p style="text-align:center;"><font color="red">Joint and Marginal Distributions</font></p>

### 1. Joint Distribution

A **joint distribution** describes the probability of two or more random variables occurring together. It shows how two (or more) variables relate to each other.

- For example, if we have two variables \( X \) (number of heads in a coin toss) and \( Y \) (outcome of a dice roll), the joint distribution gives the probability of each possible pair of outcomes for \( (X, Y) \).

**Example**: Tossing a coin and rolling a die.

| \( X \) (Heads) | \( Y \) (Dice Roll) | Probability \( P(X, Y) \) |
|-----------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| 0               | 1                   | 1/12                     |
| 0               | 2                   | 1/12                     |
| 1               | 1                   | 1/12                     |
| 1               | 2                   | 1/12                     |

The **joint probability** gives the likelihood of the pair \( (X = 1, Y = 2) \), for example.



### 2. Marginal Distribution

A **marginal distribution** focuses on the probability of a single variable, ignoring the others. It is obtained by **summing out** (or integrating out) the other variables from the joint distribution.

- In the previous example, the marginal distribution of \( X \) would give the probabilities of \( X = 0 \) or \( X = 1 \) without considering \( Y \).

**Example**: Marginal distribution of \( X \) (number of heads):

$$
P(X = 0) = P(X = 0, Y = 1) + P(X = 0, Y = 2) = 1/12 + 1/12 = 2/12 = 1/6
$$

Similarly, the marginal distribution of \( Y \) (dice roll) is obtained by summing over all possible values of \( X \).

- **Joint distribution** shows the probability of **multiple variables** occurring together.
- **Marginal distribution** gives the probability of a **single variable**, ignoring the others.

### Joint and Marginal Distributions: Example

Consider two random variables:
- \( X \): Number of heads in 1 coin toss (values: 0 or 1).
- \( Y \): Outcome of a dice roll (values: 1 to 6).

The **joint distribution** gives the probabilities for all pairs of values \( (X, Y) \).

### Joint Distribution Table

| \( X \) (Heads) | \( Y = 1 \) | \( Y = 2 \) | \( Y = 3 \) | \( Y = 4 \) | \( Y = 5 \) | \( Y = 6 \) | **Row Total** |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| 0               | 1/12        | 1/12        | 1/12        | 1/12        | 1/12        | 1/12        | 6/12 = 1/2     |
| 1               | 1/12        | 1/12        | 1/12        | 1/12        | 1/12        | 1/12        | 6/12 = 1/2     |
| **Column Total**| 2/12        | 2/12        | 2/12        | 2/12        | 2/12        | 2/12        | 1              |

### Marginal Distribution of \( X \) (Number of Heads)

To get the marginal distribution of \( X \), sum the joint probabilities over all values of \( Y \).

- For \( X = 0 \):
$$
P(X = 0) = \frac{1}{12} + \frac{1}{12} + \frac{1}{12} + \frac{1}{12} + \frac{1}{12} + \frac{1}{12} = \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2}
$$

- For \( X = 1 \):
$$
P(X = 1) = \frac{1}{12} + \frac{1}{12} + \frac{1}{12} + \frac{1}{12} + \frac{1}{12} + \frac{1}{12} = \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2}
$$

So, the **marginal distribution of \( X \)** is:
- $P(X = 0) = \frac{1}{2}$
- $P(X = 1) = \frac{1}{2}$

### Marginal Distribution of \( Y \) (Dice Roll)

To get the marginal distribution of \( Y \), sum the joint probabilities over all values of \( X \).

- For \( Y = 1 \):
$$
P(Y = 1) = \frac{1}{12} + \frac{1}{12} = \frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}
$$

- For \( Y = 2 \):
$$
P(Y = 2) = \frac{1}{12} + \frac{1}{12} = \frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}
$$

- For \( Y = 3 \):
$$
P(Y = 3) = \frac{1}{12} + \frac{1}{12} = \frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}
$$

- For \( Y = 4 \):
$$
P(Y = 4) = \frac{1}{12} + \frac{1}{12} = \frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}
$$

- For \( Y = 5 \):
$$
P(Y = 5) = \frac{1}{12} + \frac{1}{12} = \frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}
$$

- For \( Y = 6 \):
$$
P(Y = 6) = \frac{1}{12} + \frac{1}{12} = \frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}
$$

So, the **marginal distribution of \( Y \)** is:
- $P(Y = 1) = \frac{1}{6}$
- $P(Y = 2) = \frac{1}{6}$
- $P(Y = 3) = \frac{1}{6}$
- $P(Y = 4) = \frac{1}{6}$
- $P(Y = 5) = \frac{1}{6}$
- $P(Y = 6) = \frac{1}{6}$ 

- **Joint Distribution**: Describes the probability of each pair of values \( (X, Y) \).
- **Marginal Distribution**: Describes the probability of a single variable, by summing over the other variables.

### 65-95-99 Property of Normal Distribution

The **65-95-99 property** refers to the approximate percentage of data points that lie within certain numbers of standard deviations from the mean in a **normal distribution**.

1. **65%**: About **65%** of the data falls within **1 standard deviation** of the mean.
2. **95%**: About **95%** of the data falls within **2 standard deviations** of the mean.
3. **99%**: About **99%** of the data falls within **3 standard deviations** of the mean.

This property is a result of the **empirical rule**, which states that for a normal distribution:
- 68% of the data lies within 1 standard deviation from the mean.
- 95% lies within 2 standard deviations.
- 99.7% lies within 3 standard deviations.

### Visual Representation:


   |------------------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|  
Mean - 2σ      Mean - 1σ              Mean             Mean + 1σ           Mean + 2σ 

![[9a.png]]

This gives you a sense of how data is spread around the mean in a normal distribution.

---

### Standardization and Z-Score

### Standardization

**Standardization** refers to the process of converting a normal distribution into a **standard normal distribution**, which has:
- **Mean = 0**
- **Standard Deviation = 1**

The goal of standardization is to make different data sets comparable, even if they have different units or scales. This is achieved by **transforming** the data values using the formula for the **Z-score**.

![[9d.png]]


### Z-Score

The **Z-score** measures how many standard deviations a data point is away from the mean of the distribution.

#### Formula:
$$
Z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
$$

Where:
- $X$ is the value of the data point.
- $\mu$ is the mean of the distribution.
- $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the distribution.

#### Interpretation of Z-Score:
- **Z = 0**: The data point is exactly at the mean.
- **Z > 0**: The data point is above the mean.
- **Z < 0**: The data point is below the mean.

### **Distance from the Mean**

The **distance from the mean** refers to how far a specific data point is from the average value in terms of standard deviations. 

For example, if a Z-score is **2**, the data point is **2 standard deviations** away from the mean. This distance gives us a sense of how extreme a particular value is in the distribution. 

- **Higher Z-scores** indicate that the data point is farther away from the mean, implying it’s an **outlier** or an **extreme value**.
- **Lower Z-scores** (close to 0) suggest that the data point is close to the mean, implying that it’s more typical or expected.

## <p style="text-align:center;"><font color="red">Population, Sample, Parameter, and Statistic</font></p>

Understanding the basic building blocks of statistics is essential for proper data analysis. These include:

## Population

- The **entire group** of individuals or items that you're interested in studying.
- It includes **all possible observations**.
- Populations can be **finite** (e.g., all students in a school) or **infinite** (e.g., all possible coin flips).

**Example**: All residents of a country.


## Sample

- A **subset of the population**, selected for actual analysis.
- Used when it is **impractical or impossible** to study the whole population.
- Must be selected **randomly** and **representatively** to draw valid conclusions.

**Example**: 1,000 randomly chosen residents from the country.



## Parameter

- A **numerical value** that describes a characteristic of the **population**.
- Usually **unknown** and **fixed**.

**Examples**:
- Population mean ($\mu$)
- Population proportion ($p$)



## Statistic

- A **numerical value** that describes a characteristic of a **sample**.
- Calculated from sample data and used to **estimate population parameters**.
- It varies from sample to sample.

**Examples**:
- Sample mean ($\bar{x}$)
- Sample proportion ($\hat{p}$)

**Key Insight**:  
We use **statistics** (from the sample) to make inferences about **parameters** (of the population).

## <p style="text-align:center;"><font color="red">Abstract View of Sampling and Random Variables</font></p>

### What is Sampling?

Sampling is the process of selecting a **subset of observations** from a larger **population** in order to **learn about the whole**. The process introduces **randomness**, because the outcome (i.e., the sample you get) depends on chance.

### Key Point:
Every time you draw a sample, you might get **different values**. This is what makes sampling inherently **random**.

---

### Each Sample as a Random Variable

When you draw a sample, you’re essentially performing a **random experiment**:
- Each sample is **one possible outcome** from the set of all possible samples.
- Because the values in the sample vary due to chance, we can think of the **sample itself as a random variable**.

Let’s say you’re drawing a sample of size $n$ from a population:
- You can denote this sample as $(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n)$.
- Each $X_i$ is a **random variable**, representing the $i$-th observation in the sample.

---

### Sample Mean as a Random Variable

The **sample mean** is calculated as:

$$
\bar{X} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i
$$

Since each $X_i$ is a random variable, the sample mean $\bar{X}$ is also a **function of random variables** — and hence, **itself a random variable**.

### Why This Matters:
- Different samples will give different means.
- The sample mean has its own **distribution**, known as the **sampling distribution** of the mean.
- As the sample size increases, this distribution becomes more tightly clustered around the population mean (by the **Law of Large Numbers**).
- According to the **Central Limit Theorem**, the sampling distribution of the mean approaches a **normal distribution**, even if the population isn’t normal (for large enough $n$).

---

### Summary

| Concept            | Description                                                       |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Sampling**        | Randomly selecting a subset from the population.                 |
| **Sample**          | A collection of random variables $(X_1, ..., X_n)$.              |
| **Sample Mean**     | A random variable derived from the sample.                       |
| **Sampling Distribution** | The distribution of the sample mean across many samples.         |

---

**Key Insight**:  
The randomness in sampling makes each sample and its summary measures (like the mean) **random variables**. This is the foundation of **statistical inference**, where we make conclusions about population parameters based on the behavior of sample statistics.


## <p style="text-align:center;"><font color="red">Central Limit Theorem (CLT)</font></p>

## 

The **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** is a fundamental concept in statistics. It states that:

> When you take **many random samples** of a sufficiently large size from **any population** (with finite mean and variance), the **distribution of the sample means** will approximate a **normal distribution** — **regardless of the original population's distribution**.

---

## Key Components

- **Population**: Can be of any shape — skewed, uniform, etc.
- **Sample Size (n)**: Should be reasonably large (usually **n ≥ 30** is enough).
- **Sample Mean ($\bar{X}$)**: The average of values in each sample.
- **Sampling Distribution**: The distribution formed by all possible sample means.

As the sample size increases:
- The shape of the sampling distribution becomes more **normal**.
- The sampling distribution is **centered** at the population mean ($\mu$).
- The **standard deviation** of the sampling distribution (called the **standard error**) becomes smaller:

$$
\text{Standard Error} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

---

## Why It Matters

- **Makes statistical inference possible**: We can use the normal distribution to make confidence intervals and hypothesis tests.
- **Applies even when population is not normal**: The beauty of CLT is that it doesn’t require a normally distributed population.

| Concept               | Description                                 |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Population             | Any shape (normal, skewed, etc.)            |
| Sampling               | Repeated random samples of size $n$         |
| Sample Means           | Each sample has a mean                      |
| Sampling Distribution  | The means form a bell-shaped curve          |
| Normal Approximation   | Works well when $n$ is large (≥ 30)         |

---

**Key Insight**:  
The Central Limit Theorem tells us that **averages behave predictably**, even when the data itself is messy or non-normal.

## <p style="text-align:center;"><font color="red">Confidence Interval and the Central Limit Theorem</font></p>

### What is a Confidence Interval?

A **Confidence Interval (CI)** is a range of values that is used to estimate a **population parameter** (like the mean) based on **sample data**.

It tells us:
> "We are X% confident that the true population mean lies within this range."

A common form of a confidence interval for the population mean is:

$$
\bar{X} \pm z^* \cdot \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

Where:
- $\bar{X}$ = Sample mean  
- $z^*$ = Critical value from the standard normal distribution (based on desired confidence level, like 1.96 for 95%)  
- $\sigma$ = Population standard deviation  
- $n$ = Sample size  

---

### How is it Related to the Central Limit Theorem?

The **CLT** says that:
- The distribution of the sample means is **approximately normal** if the sample size is large enough.
- This allows us to use the **normal distribution** to calculate probabilities and **construct confidence intervals**, even if the original data isn’t normally distributed.

### Without CLT:
We couldn’t justify using the **standard normal curve** to make probabilistic statements about sample means.

---

### Interpretation of a 95% Confidence Interval

A 95% CI means:
- If you were to take **many random samples** and build a confidence interval from each,
- About **95% of those intervals** would contain the **true population mean**.

**Important**: It does NOT mean there's a 95% chance the population mean is in your single calculated interval — the mean is fixed, and the interval is random.

---

### Example (Conceptual)

Suppose:
- You measure average height from a sample of students: $\bar{X} = 170$ cm
- You want a 95% CI
- Assume known $\sigma = 10$ and $n = 100$

Then:

$$
\text{CI} = 170 \pm 1.96 \cdot \frac{10}{\sqrt{100}} = 170 \pm 1.96
$$

So, the 95% CI is: **[168.04, 171.96]**

The **Central Limit Theorem** provides the foundation for constructing **confidence intervals**, by ensuring that the **sample mean behaves predictably** — allowing us to use the **normal distribution** even when the population is unknown or not normal.
